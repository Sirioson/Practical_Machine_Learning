Practical_Machine_Learning
==========================

The R-code.Rmd and R-code.html both contain (the same) R-code, which builds a predictive model on a HAR dataset.
It is used in a Coursera "Practical Machine Learning" course.

The project paper "Project_Practical_Machine_Learning.Rmd" gives details about the R-code, discusses the results, contains references and is in other ways a description of the project and the code.
