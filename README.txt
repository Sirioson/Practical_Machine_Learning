Practical_Machine_Learning
==========================

The Project_pml_2.Rmd and Project_pml_2.html both contain (the same) R-code, which
builds a predictive model on a HAR dataset.
It is used in a Coursera "Practical Machine Learning" course.

The project paper "Project_Practical_Machine_Learning.Rmd" gives details about the R-code,
discusses the results, contains references and is in other ways a description of the project and the code.
